**Numl** is the **alternative markup language** for the modern and future web whose goal is to create a future-proof abstraction over modern web-technology with simplified **API** based on web standards (**HTML**, **CSS**, **ARIA** specifications) and predictable unified behavior across all the modern browsers, platforms and devices.

You can consider this a replacement (at least partial) for **HTML**, **CSS** and even **JavaScript** in some cases.

It also fits the following definitions:

* Multi-purpose [HTML Framework](!https://paulbakaus.com/tutorials/css/where-to-start-if-you-want-to-become-a-web-developer/#2_Start_building_your_first_pages_and_sites_with_an_HTML_framework)
* Modern [CSS Framework](!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) with unique set of features.
* [CSS Methodology](!https://www.creativebloq.com/features/a-web-designers-guide-to-css-methodologies) with own future-proof approach.
* Low-level [JS Framework](/framework/what-is-nude) based on Custom Elements with life-cycle hooks and UX-oriented features.
* Comprehensive [Design System](!https://uxmisfit.com/2019/03/26/what-is-a-design-system-everything-you-need-to-know/) out-of-the-box.
* A decent sized set of reusable **UI Components**.

## Benefits of usage

There are many benefits of using **Numl** in your projects. You can get:

* Highly-customizable Design System.
* Convenient theming system for developers.
* Much faster prototyping speed. (don't even require build step)
* Best CSS practices under-the-hood.
* Automatic Dark Mode and High Contrast Mode.
* Transferable markup. Use it in projects with different frontend stack.

All it means you can save your time and money for your company a lot.
