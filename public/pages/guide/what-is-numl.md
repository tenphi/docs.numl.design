**Numl** is a markup and style language to create modern high-quality web-interfaces with any look using HTML-based syntax. It utilizes the power of Web Components and creates all the CSS needed right in runtime as it requires, which makes it much more flexible than any other styling solution. Built-in elements will allow you to make gorgeous interfaces and accessible components without inventing your own Design System or UI library.

You can consider this a replacement (at least partial) for **HTML**, **CSS** and even **JavaScript** in some cases.

It also fits the following definitions:

* Multi-purpose [HTML Framework](!https://paulbakaus.com/tutorials/css/where-to-start-if-you-want-to-become-a-web-developer/#2_Start_building_your_first_pages_and_sites_with_an_HTML_framework)
* Modern [CSS Framework](!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework) with unique set of features.
* [CSS Methodology](!https://www.creativebloq.com/features/a-web-designers-guide-to-css-methodologies) with own future-proof approach.
* Low-level [JS Framework](/framework/what-is-nude) based on Custom Elements with life-cycle hooks and UX-oriented features.
* Comprehensive [Design System](!https://uxmisfit.com/2019/03/26/what-is-a-design-system-everything-you-need-to-know/) out-of-the-box.
* A decent sized set of reusable **UI Components**.

## Benefits of usage

There are many benefits of using **Numl** in your projects. You can get:

* Highly-customizable Design System.
* Convenient theming system for developers.
* Much faster prototyping speed. (don't even require build step)
* Best CSS practices under-the-hood.
* Automatic Dark Mode and High Contrast Mode.
* Transferable markup. Use it in projects with different frontend stack.

All it means you can save your time and money for your company a lot.
