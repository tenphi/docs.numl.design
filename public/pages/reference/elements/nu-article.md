A **semantic** element. Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry.

A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls, each post would be contained in an `<nu-article>` element, possibly with one or more `<nu-section>`s within.

You can add `role="article"` on other elements to change their role.

```html
<split/>
<nu-attrs
  for="icon"
  name="cloud-rain" place="right 0 2x" size="6x"></nu-attrs>

<nu-article gap="2x">
  <nu-attrs
    for="article" padding="1x 2x"
    shadow radius box="y"></nu-attrs>
  <nu-h3 size="h5">Weather forecast for Seattle</nu-h3>
  <nu-article>
